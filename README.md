# GeoGuessr - Play for free

As we all know, GeoGuessr has moved to the freemium model and limits the number of games we can play in a day. IMO GeoGuessr took this step due to the sudden rise in user base and hosting's billing. Thus GeoGuessr's move is right according to me, as it is good to have paid GeoGuessr rather than no GeoGuessr, right? Nonetheless, my broken-ass wasn't able to afford the paid model, so I made temporary mails to play country streak. Thus, inspiration for this project: automatically register as a new user (using temp mail) and navigate to country streak to play games for free.

Note: Please don't abuse this project and overload/harm GeoGuessr. I'm a broke guy who plays GeoGuessr maybe once a month, that too rage quit after 2-3 games xD.
